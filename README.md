# ML_streamlit_simple_SVM
 
This code illustrates how one can create a web interface and run any model using the streamlit library. 
The model is a simple one: a Support vector machine performing classification of a given wine quality based on its chemical specificities. The interface allows the user
to choose its own wine composition and have it ranked.
The dataset on wine quality can be found on Kaggle and is also available on this repository as well as the interface images.
